Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It gives me the possibility to work offline.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are copies of repositories that I dont own. I can make them directly on github with the fork-function.
I can use a fork to build my own repository based on an foreign repository. I can't push changes to the foreign repo but only to my own.

Clones are local copies of any git-repositories (remote or local). I can push changes directly to the origin repo. I can use a local clone of a remote repository.
It gives me the possibility to make my changes offline and then later push it to the (cloned) remote repo.
 
Branches are parallel versions in the same repository. I can use it p.e. to seperate different implementations on the same function. branches can be merged later.
