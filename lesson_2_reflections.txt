What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The git init will create a .git directory (it's hidden ;-)). It's the first step for creating a new git repo


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging Area contains files that allready added to it by git add. the working directory contains all files no matter if thei are added or not. i get information about it by the command git status
